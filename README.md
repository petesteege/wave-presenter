Wave Presenter
A Quick Start Guide

This guide helps you use Wave Presenter to manage and visualize your audio.

1. Loading Your Audio
To begin, load an audio file into the program:
* Click the “Load Audio” button.
* In the pop-up, choose to either:
    * Select a file from your computer (MP3, WAV, etc.).
    * Paste a direct URL to an audio file online.
* Click “Load.” The program’s title will update to your audio file’s name.

2. Understanding the Layout
Once audio is loaded, you’ll see:
* Project Title (Top): Shows your current audio file’s name.
* Theme Toggle (Top Right): Switches between light and dark modes.
* Waveform: The main visual display of your audio.
* Timeline: Shows audio duration (MM:SS) below the waveform.
* Sections Label: Identifies the section bar.
* Sections Bar: Displays your defined audio sections as colored blocks with titles and descriptions.
* Section Markers: Colored dots and vertical lines on the waveform indicate section start/end points.
* Handles: Small circles on the Sections Bar that let you adjust section start and end times by dragging.

3. Audio Controls
Below the waveform, you’ll find playback controls:
* Rewind (Replay icon): Jumps to the start of the audio.
* Play (Play arrow icon): Starts or resumes playback.
* Pause (Pause icon): Pauses playback.
* Stop (Stop icon): Stops playback and resets to the beginning.

4. Project Controls
These buttons manage your project and sections:
* Focus Mode (Eye icon): Toggles visibility of most UI elements (like buttons, sections bar, recent projects) to provide a clear view of only the waveform and timeline. The theme toggle will dim. Click again to show all elements.
* Add New Section: Creates a new, pre-filled section block on your timeline.
* Save Project (ZIP): Saves your audio and all sections into a single .zip file. You’ll name the project.
* Load Project (ZIP): Loads a previously saved .zip project.

5. Managing Sections
Sections help you organize and annotate your audio.
* Add: Click “Add New Section” to create a new one. It gets a default title, description, and color.
* Edit: Click any colored section block in the “Sections Bar” to open the “Edit Section” window. Here you can:
    * Change its Title and Description.
    * Pick a new Color.
    * Remove the section.
    * Save your changes or Cancel.
* Adjust Times: Drag the circular handles on the “Sections Bar” to precisely set a section’s start and end points.

6. Recent Projects
Below the main controls, “Recent Projects” lists your last 10 loaded or saved projects.
* Click a project name to quickly reload it.
* Click the small ‘x’ next to a project name to remove it from the list.

7. Other Notes
* Toast Notifications: Brief messages appear in the top right to confirm actions or warn about issues.
* Modals: Pop-up windows (like Load Audio, Edit Section) require you to interact with them before returning to the main interface.
